            <h2><strong>ROM</strong></h2>
            <p class="date">Oct 1st, 2021</p>
            <p class="main-text">ROM (Read-only Memory), also known as firmware, is a storage medium that contains
                permanent non-volatile data. Read-only Memory contains the programming information that lets a computing
                device regenerate or startup whenever the switch is on. This is also the part of a computer that
                executes massive input/output (I/O) tasks and safeguards software instructions or programs. There can be
                no removal of the data stored on a ROM chip.
                Most computers integrate a tiny amount of ROM that hosts the startup firmware. BIOS (basic input/output
                system) is another terminology for the boot firmware. A set of codes makes up this software that directs
                the computer boot-up processes. This includes carrying out hardware diagnostics and loading OS
                (Operating System) into the RAM (Random Access Memory). As a result of this, ROM is frequently used when
                updating firmware.</p>

            <h2><strong>Custom ROM</strong></h2>
            <p class="main-text">Custom ROM is a uniquely modified operating system developed and built by a third party
                vendor which is available for older or newer devices before the manufacturer update release. A custom
                ROM offers more refined and customized user controls and flexibility than the Stock ROM because the
                device is completely unlocked so that users can customize their device to their taste. A custom ROM
                replaces your device’s original Android operating system with a new version of the Android operating
                system. However, replacing the stock ROM with a custom ROM may void the warranty of the device. Custom
                ROMs are developed mostly by a community of core developers who do some modifications to the original
                firmware that is based on the Android source code and release the new version of the firmware with
                improved functionalities and more customization options. A custom ROM is like the same body as a stock
                ROM but with a different soul.</p>

            <h2><strong>Difference between Stock ROM and Custom ROM</strong></h2>
            <h3>Firmware</h3>
            <p class="main-text">– ROM is nothing but the operating system of the mobile device. Stock ROM is the
                default ROM – that is, the operating system – provided by the device manufacturer. Stock ROM is the
                official firmware of the device manufacturer that goes through rigorous testing and scheduled release
                cycles. A custom ROM, on the other hand, is an unofficial firmware for a specific device developed by
                some independent developers who did some modifications to the source code and release it to the general
                public. Custom ROM is a uniquely modified firmware developed and built by a third party vendor.</p>

            <h3>Stability</h3>
            <p class="main-text">– Stock ROM is the original and the official software designed by the device
                manufacturer for that particular device and which goes through rigorous testing and scheduled release
                cycles to ensure the stability of the operating system. Custom ROMs, on the other hand, can be
                notoriously unstable because they are being developed and tested independently at a much faster pace,
                and the unscheduled release cycles mean there is no assurance on the stability of the OS.</p>

            <h3>Performance</h3>
            <p class="main-text">– Although, the official firmware, which is the stock ROM, is more stable than a custom
                ROM, no overclocking is allowed and users often get restrictions in the functionalities of the device
                based on region, carrier, etc. However, stock ROMs are designed to deliver optimal performance thanks to
                their stable environment. Custom ROMs, on the other hand, allow for extensive customizations and all
                kinds of performance enhancements, such as battery performance, new themes, new UI, and more.</p>
